Lesson 5: 
1. Variables
2. Re-assgin variables 
3. Cart Quantity practice
4. Shortcuts for re-assigning variables
5. Naming conventions
6. 3 types of variable creation: const, let, var 
Note: use const by default, do not use var 

Lesson 6: 
1. Boolean values (true, false)
2. If-statements      (if (condition) {} else {};)
3. Comparison Operators (===, !==, <=, >=) and Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
4. Alogirthms (created Rock Paper Scissors)
5. Truthy and Falsy values
6. Shortscuts for if-statements (ternary, guard, default)

Lesson 7:
  1. Functions = let us reuse code
  2. Return = get a value out of a function 
  3. Parameters = put values into a function
  4. Improved the code for Rock, Paper, Scissors 

    Notes: 
    Functions - lets us reuse code, easier to update code in future, can contain a return 

      Rules of functions and parameters: 
        1. Can't use special words (ex: function)
        2. Can't start with a number
        3. Can't use special characters except: $_

        Use camelCase!

      Scope can help prevent naming conflits. 

Lesson 8:

    Notes: 
    Object - groups multiple values together 
  
    Makes our code more organized into one object 
    Use multiple values together 
    Can be used to display all values at once 
    Objects themselves are also values 
    Functions can also be saved in objects (aka Method)

    Dot Notation - to access property of objects (use by default)

    Bracket Notation - let us use properties that don't work with dot notation

    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
      -a syntax
      -similar to Javascript object, but has less features
      -difference from JS object: must use double quotes for propery and values, and does not support functions 
      -JSON is more universal, use JSON when we send data between computers 
      -use when we store data 
      -Converts JS Object into JSON 

    Variables are temporary. If we refresh or close the page, all previous data of our variables get deleted. Therefore, we should use JSON to save our data.
